# About The Project

This project is for the Rennes School of Business course Programming for Data Analytics.  It seeks to show that, without compromising economic growth, increasing energy efficiency—that is, lowering energy intensity—is essential for sustainable development.  Using extensive global energy databases, we examine the relationship between energy intensity, adoption of renewable energy, and economic performance across several nations.  Through the use of descriptive analytics, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modelling techniques, we want to understand the moderating effect of income inequality in this dynamic and identify important variables that have a major impact on energy intensity trends.

Our methodology involves the visualisation of energy intensity distributions, the analysis of GDP growth in conjunction with energy transitions, the investigation of correlations between the percentage of renewable energy and gains in energy efficiency, and the development of prediction models to estimate future energy intensity levels.  Policymakers and professionals in the energy sector navigating the shift to low-carbon economies will benefit greatly from the insights gained from this analysis, which will also improve our understanding of how nations can accomplish sustainable energy transitions while sustaining strong economic growth.

The analysis will use predictive modelling to predict future energy intensity levels based on identified influential factors, exploratory data analysis (EDA) to find connections between energy efficiency improvements and the adoption of renewable energy, and descriptive analytics to summarise historical trends in energy intensity.  By working together, we hope to use our combined expertise in statistical modelling, data analysis, and programming to produce a thorough report that addresses the crucial research question: How do renewable energy adoption and energy efficiency improvements jointly influence energy intensity, and what role does income inequality play in moderating this relationship across countries during 2000-2020?
