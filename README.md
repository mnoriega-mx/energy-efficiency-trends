# About The Project

This project is for the Rennes School of Business course Programming for Data Analytics.  It seeks to show that, without compromising economic growth, increasing energy efficiency—that is, lowering energy intensity—is essential for sustainable development.  Using extensive global energy databases, we examine the relationship between energy intensity, adoption of renewable energy, and economic performance across several nations.  Through the use of descriptive analytics, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modelling techniques, we want to understand the moderating effect of income inequality in this dynamic and identify important variables that have a major impact on energy intensity trends.

Our methodology involves the visualisation of energy intensity distributions, the analysis of GDP growth in conjunction with energy transitions, the investigation of correlations between the percentage of renewable energy and gains in energy efficiency, and the development of prediction models to estimate future energy intensity levels.  Policymakers and professionals in the energy sector navigating the shift to low-carbon economies will benefit greatly from the insights gained from this analysis, which will also improve our understanding of how nations can accomplish sustainable energy transitions while sustaining strong economic growth.

The analysis will use predictive modelling to predict future energy intensity levels based on identified influential factors, exploratory data analysis (EDA) to find connections between energy efficiency improvements and the adoption of renewable energy, and descriptive analytics to summarise historical trends in energy intensity.  By working together, we hope to use our combined expertise in statistical modelling, data analysis, and programming to produce a thorough report that addresses the crucial research question: How do renewable energy adoption and energy efficiency improvements jointly influence energy intensity, and what role does income inequality play in moderating this relationship across countries during 2000-2020?

# Analysis Approach
The following elements make up our methodology:

- Monitor trends in energy intensity: To find trends of improvement or decline over time, track the Energy Intensity Level of Primary Energy (measured in MJ/$2017 PPP GDP) across nations from 2000 to 2020.


- Correlate with renewable energy: Analyse the connection between gains in renewable energy share (calculated as a percentage of total final energy consumption and equivalent primary energy) and improvements in energy intensity.

- Examine economic performance: Show that efficiency gains do not jeopardise economic growth by comparing trends in energy intensity with GDP growth rates and GDP per capita.

- Determine the signs of technological adoption:  Examine how energy intensity decrease is influenced by low-carbon electricity percentages, renewable electricity generation capacity per person, and power from renewable sources.

- Examine the effects of income inequality: Find out how the adoption of renewable energy reduces energy intensity in a way that is moderated by income inequality (as measured by GDP per capita distribution and economic development indicators).
