# Analyzing the Relationship Between Economic Growth and Energy Efficiency in the Transition to Sustainable Energy

# About The Project
The project is completed for the Rennes School of Business course Programming for Data Analytics. It investigates the crucial role of energy efficiency in supporting sustainable development without compromising. Using extensive global energy databases, we examine the relationship between energy intensity, adoption of renewable energy, and economic performance across several nations. Through the use of descriptive analytics, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modelling techniques, we want to understand the moderating effect of income inequality in this dynamic and identify important variables that have a major impact on energy intensity trends.

Our methodology involves the visualisation of energy intensity distributions, the analysis of GDP growth in conjunction with energy transitions, the investigation of correlations between the percentage of renewable energy and gains in energy efficiency, and the development of prediction models to estimate future energy intensity levels.  This analysis offers practical guidance for policymakers and energy professionals on how countries can transition to sustainable energy systems while sustaining economic growth.

This analysis applies predictive modeling to estimate future energy intensity levels based on key influencing factors, exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is used to explore relationships between energy efficiency improvements and renewable energy adoption, while descriptive analytics summarize historical trends in energy intensity.
By working together and combining our skills in statistical modeling, data analysis, and programming, we aim to develop a comprehensive report addressing the central question:
**How do renewable energy adoption and energy efficiency improvements jointly affect energy intensity, and how does income inequality influence this relationship across countries between 2000 and 2020?**

# The Dataset
The dataset for this project was extracted from [Kaggle’s Global Data on Sustainable Energy](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anshtanwar/global-data-on-sustainable-energy) and selected to provide valuable insights into Global Data on Sustainable Energy.  It covers a wide range of sustainable energy indicators for countries worldwide between 2000 and 2020, including energy intensity, carbon emissions, renewable energy adoption, financial flows, electricity access, and economic growth. This resource enables cross-country comparisons, tracks progress toward Sustainable Development Goal 7, and reveals long-term global trends in energy use.


# Analysis Approach

Our approach consists of several key steps aimed at understanding the drivers and impacts of energy efficiency:

- **Track energy intensity trends:** Analyze changes in the Energy Intensity Level of Primary Energy (MJ/$2017 PPP GDP) for countries worldwide from 2000 to 2020, highlighting patterns of improvement or decline.

- **Explore links to renewable energy:** Assess how increases in renewable energy’s share (as a percentage of total final energy consumption and primary energy) correspond with reductions in energy intensity.

- **Assess economic growth alongside efficiency:** Compare trends in energy intensity with metrics like GDP growth rates and GDP per capita to demonstrate that efficiency improvements do not come at the expense of economic performance.

- **Identify technological influences:** Investigate the impact of low-carbon electricity, renewable generation capacity per capita, and renewable power production on driving down energy intensity.

- **Evaluate income inequality effects:** Examine how income distribution and development indicators shape the effect of renewable energy expansion on energy intensity, with a focus on potential moderating or amplifying roles.



# Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning:** Prepare the datasets by addressing missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies across fields like energy intensity, renewable energy share, GDP, and income inequality.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualize long-term country-level trends in energy intensity, adoption of renewables, economic growth, and technological progress.

3. **Descriptive Analytics:** Summarize key statistics and build country profiles to understand historical variations and progress in energy efficiency and renewables uptake.

4. **Diagnostic Analysis:** Pinpoint root causes and identify threshold effects, especially how income inequality influences the relationship between renewable energy growth and energy efficiency improvements.

5. **Predictive Analytics:** Construct forecasting models to estimate future energy intensity levels using influential predictors such as renewable share, GDP trends, and technological factors.

6. **Prescriptive Analytics:** Develop actionable recommendations for energy, climate, and economic policies that target reductions in energy intensity while promoting equitable and sustainable outcomes.
