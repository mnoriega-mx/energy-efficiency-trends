# About The Project

This project is for the Rennes School of Business course Programming for Data Analytics.  It seeks to show that, without compromising economic growth, increasing energy efficiency—that is, lowering energy intensity—is essential for sustainable development.  Using extensive global energy databases, we examine the relationship between energy intensity, adoption of renewable energy, and economic performance across several nations.  Through the use of descriptive analytics, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modelling techniques, we want to understand the moderating effect of income inequality in this dynamic and identify important variables that have a major impact on energy intensity trends.

Our methodology involves the visualisation of energy intensity distributions, the analysis of GDP growth in conjunction with energy transitions, the investigation of correlations between the percentage of renewable energy and gains in energy efficiency, and the development of prediction models to estimate future energy intensity levels.  Policymakers and professionals in the energy sector navigating the shift to low-carbon economies will benefit greatly from the insights gained from this analysis, which will also improve our understanding of how nations can accomplish sustainable energy transitions while sustaining strong economic growth.

The analysis will use predictive modelling to predict future energy intensity levels based on identified influential factors, exploratory data analysis (EDA) to find connections between energy efficiency improvements and the adoption of renewable energy, and descriptive analytics to summarise historical trends in energy intensity.  By working together, we hope to use our combined expertise in statistical modelling, data analysis, and programming to produce a thorough report that addresses the crucial research question: How do renewable energy adoption and energy efficiency improvements jointly influence energy intensity, and what role does income inequality play in moderating this relationship across countries during 2000-2020?

# The Dataset
The datasets have been obtained through [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anshtanwar/global-data-on-sustainable-energy) platform and selected to provide relevants insights regarding Global Data on Sustainable Energy (2000-2020).

global-data-on-sustainable-energy: This dataset from 2000 to 2020 shows sustainable energy metrics and other helpful factors for every country.  Examine important topics like energy intensity, financial flows, carbon emissions, renewable energy, electrical access, and economic growth.  Compare countries, monitor the advancement of Sustainable Development Goal 7, and obtain deep understanding of the trends in global energy use over time.

# Analysis Approach
The following elements make up our methodology:

- Monitor trends in energy intensity: To find trends of improvement or decline over time, track the Energy Intensity Level of Primary Energy (measured in MJ/$2017 PPP GDP) across nations from 2000 to 2020.


- Correlate with renewable energy: Analyse the connection between gains in renewable energy share (calculated as a percentage of total final energy consumption and equivalent primary energy) and improvements in energy intensity.

- Examine economic performance: Show that efficiency gains do not jeopardise economic growth by comparing trends in energy intensity with GDP growth rates and GDP per capita.

- Determine the signs of technological adoption:  Examine how energy intensity decrease is influenced by low-carbon electricity percentages, renewable electricity generation capacity per person, and power from renewable sources.

- Examine the effects of income inequality: Find out how the adoption of renewable energy reduces energy intensity in a way that is moderated by income inequality (as measured by GDP per capita distribution and economic development indicators).

# Methodology
1. Data Cleaning: Preprocess the global energy datasets to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in energy intensity, renewable energy share, GDP, and income inequality fields.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize trends in energy intensity (MJ/$2011 PPP GDP) across countries from 2000-2020, and examine patterns in renewable energy adoption, economic growth, and technological advancement.

3. Descriptive Analytics: Generate summary statistics and country-wise profiles to provide insights into historical progress and variation in energy intensity and renewables adoption.

4. Diagnostic Analysis: Investigate root causes and threshold effects—specifically, how income inequality moderates or hinders the relationship between renewable energy expansion and improvements in energy efficiency.

5. Predictive Analytics: Build models to forecast energy intensity based on influential variables, including renewable energy share, GDP growth, and technology indicators, to assess potential future sustainable outcomes.

6. Prescriptive Analytics: Develop recommendations for energy, climate, and economic policies that optimize reductions in energy intensity while promoting equitable, sustainable development.
